          <td>The first day in London begins bright and early, before 10 am. Head to the popular <a href="https://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/hyde-park">Hyde Park</a> (maybe have a picnic there whilst you're at it?). We recommend going for a stroll through the park heading south to Wellington Arch. Walking through the adjacent woodland, Green Park, you will get to the forecourt of <a href="https://www.royal.uk/search?tags%5B0%5D=Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a>, where you can witness the famous ceremony of the <a href="https://www.changing-guard.com/dates-buckingham-palace.html">Changing the Guard</a> (remember to check the dates beforehand). After seeing the regiments and the bands, crossing another of London’s green lungs, <a href="https://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/st-jamess-park">St. James’s Park</a>, you’ll get to <a href="https://www.westminster-abbey.org/">Westminster Abbey</a>. This is one of the city’s most important landmark and is definitely worth a visit!. When you leave the abbey, head towards the River Thames, where you can spot the city’s main symbols; <a href="https://www.parliament.uk/bigben">Big Ben</a> and the <a href="https://www.londoneye.com/">London Eye</a></td>
          <td>Start your second day at the <a href="https://www.britishmuseum.org/">British Museum</a>, whose permanent collection of some eight million works is among the largest and most comprehensive in existence! Then, head on over to the <a href="https://www.coventgarden.london/">Covent Garden</a> area for a quick bite or for some window shopping. You can then head over to the <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/">National Gallery</a> where you'll also get the chance to visit the iconic <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/about-us/our-building-and-squares/trafalgar-square">Trafalgar Square.</a> After your visit, hop on the tube to Ladbroke Grove to explore <a href="http://www.portobelloroad.co.uk">Portobello Road Market</a>, the world’s largest and best known antique and second-hand clothes market. In addition, the market is also a haven for lovers of food, music and books. The market is located in the Notting Hill district, which is known for its colorful pastel buildings, high-end shopping, trendy Instagrammable restaurants, and beautiful terraces.</td>
          <td>Take the Tube to Old Street where you'll reach the heart of <a href="https://www.timeout.com/london/things-to-do/shoreditch-area-guide">Shoreditch</a>, East London's hipster hotspot. Take a walk down Brick Lane and Redchurch Street to check out the street art. There are also tons of vintage clothing shops such as <a href="http://www.atikalondon.co.uk/">Atika</a> and <a href="http://www.vintage-market.co.uk/">The Vintage Market</a>. For lunch, Brick Lane is home to countless Indian eateries each vying for your patronage. If you’re prepared to wait, you can check out <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/shoreditch/">Dishoom</a>, which has some of the best Indian food in the entire city. For a post-lunch snack, why not try a salt beef bagel at <a href="https://londonist.com/london/food/things-you-probably-didn-t-know-about-beigel-bake">Beigel Bake</a>, a famous 24 hour bagel shop. Priced at less than £5, you'll be hard pressed to find a cheaper eat in London than at this iconic East London institution.</td>

          <td>A visit to London will not be complete without catching at least one Broadway musical at <a href="https://www.westendtheatrebookings.com/">West End</a>. Pro-tip: You can buy discounted tickets off <a href="https://www.lastminute.com">LastMinute.com</a> or at ticket booths along Leicester Square. Take a leisurely 30 min stroll or take the tube to Leicester Square to grab some dinner at the ever-bustling <a href="https://chinatown.co.uk/en/">Chinatown</a> before your show. After your show, you can head towards <a href="https://www.timeout.com/london/things-to-do/soho-area-guide">Soho</a> for a drink (or two) before heading back to your accommodation for a well-deserved rest.</td>
          <td>Head back to Central London for some evening shopping down the famous <a href="https://www.oxfordstreet.co.uk/">Oxford Street</a> - home to more than 300 shops and boasting everything from big-name brands to designer labels. Don't forget to pop by other adjacent streets such as <a href="https://www.visitlondon.com/things-to-do/place/7883674-bond-street">Bond Street</a> and <a href="https://www.visitlondon.com/things-to-do/place/64061-regent-street">Regent Street</a>. Once you’ve worked up an appetite, amble over to <a href="https://www.visitlondon.com/things-to-do/place/924587-kingly-court">Kingly Court</a> – a three-floor dining destination off Carnaby Street. This cute open-air courtyard is brimming with a host of eateries, including <a href="http://pizzapilgrims.co.uk/pizzerias/kingly-st-carnaby/">Pizza Pilgrims</a>, <a href="https://www.visitlondon.com/things-to-do/place/42662329-dirty-bones-carnaby">Dirty Bones</a> and <a href="https://www.visitlondon.com/things-to-do/place/38289809-shoryu-ramen">Shoryu</a>.</td>
          <td>Chill out on your final day in London by visiting the <a href="https://skygarden.london/">Sky Garden</a>. Some say that this is the best view of London. What’s even better is that a visit here is free! From its large observation deck, you can look out over the River Thames and see many of the places you would have visted on your trip. However, do note that you need to book your visit online in advance. This would be a fantastic place to have dinner with a view but you could also head towards the river for cheaper options, such as <a href="https://www.coppaclub.co.uk/towerbridge/">Coppa Club</a> (famous for their riverside igloos in the winter)</td>
